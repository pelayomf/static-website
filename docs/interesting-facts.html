      <p>Cats don't like change without their consent. Cats can be cooperative when something feels good, which, to a cat, is the way everything is supposed to feel as much of the time as possible. The cat is a creature of most refined and subtle perceptions naturally. </p>

      <p>Cats have always been associated with the Moon. Like the Moon, they come to life at night, escaping from humanity and wandering over housetops with their eyes beaming out through the darkness. </p>
